# Endea: Your Personal Caesar Cipher Tool

Welcome to **Endea**! This tool is your friendly companion for encrypting and decrypting text using the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm. Whether you're just starting your journey into cryptography or need a quick way to secure messages, Endea is here to help.

## 🛠 What is Endea?

Endea stands for **ENcryption & DEcryption Applicator**. It's a Python-based tool designed to make it easy for anyone to encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher—a simple, yet powerful, encryption technique.

### Why Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a great starting point for understanding how encryption works. Named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to keep his military communications secret, this cipher works by shifting each letter of the text by a certain number of places down the alphabet. It’s simple, yet effective!

  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  python endea.py -e "Hello, World!" 3
  ```

- **To Decrypt a Message**:
  ```bash
  python endea.py -d "Encrypted message here" <shift_value>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  python endea.py -d "Khoor, Zruog!" 3

## 📜 Example Scenarios

Let's say you want to send a secret message to a friend:

1. **Encrypt Your Message**:
   ```bash
   python endea.py -e "Meet me at the park at noon" 5
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Encrypted message: Rjjy rj fy ymj ufwp fy sstq
   ```

2. **Share the Encrypted Message**: You send your friend "Rjjy rj fy ymj ufwp fy sstq" and tell them the shift value is 5.

3. **Decrypt the Message**:
   ```bash
   python endea.py -d "Rjjy rj fy ymj ufwp fy sstq" 5
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Decrypted message: Meet me at the park at noon
   ```
